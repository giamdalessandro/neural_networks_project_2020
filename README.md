# neural_networks_project_2020

Repo for the project of NN 2020 based on the paper "Interpreting CNNs via Decision Trees"

## Research Objectives
- How to explain features of a middle layer in a CNN at the semantic level. I.e. we aim to transform chaotic features of filters inside a CNN into semantically meaningful concepts, such as object parts, so as to help people to understand the knowledge in the CNN.
- How to quantitatively analyze the rationale of each CNN prediction. We need to figure out which filters/parts pass their information through the CNN and contribute to the prediction output. We also report the numerical contribution of each filter (or object part) to the output score.
